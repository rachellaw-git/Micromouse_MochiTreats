## About Micromouse

> Micromouse is an event where small robot mice solve a 16×16 maze. It began in the late 1970s. Events are held worldwide, and are most popular in the UK, U.S., Japan, Singapore, India, South Korea and becoming popular in subcontinent countries such as Sri Lanka.

### Competition Details

The maze is made up of a **16×16 grid** of cells, each:
- **180 mm** square
- Walls **50 mm** high

### How It Works

The mice are completely autonomous robots that must find their way from a predetermined starting position to the central area of the maze unaided. 

**The mouse must:**
1. Keep track of where it is
2. Discover walls as it explores
3. Map out the maze
4. Detect when it has reached the goal

Once the goal is reached, the mouse typically performs additional searches of the maze until it has found an optimal route from start to finish. After finding the optimal route, the mouse will run that route in the shortest possible time.

Competitions and conferences are still run regularly.
